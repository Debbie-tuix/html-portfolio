Hi, I’m Deborah Afiagh — a curious mind with a love for creativity, clean design, and purposeful technology. I’m currently learning web development, one step (and one bug fix) at a time, and I’m loving how much there is to explore. Whether I’m building a landing page or planning something bigger for the future, I care about the *why* behind everything I do.

When I’m not coding or sketching out ideas, you’ll probably find me immersed in music, writing thoughts in my notes app, or exploring how tech can solve real problems — especially in health and sustainability. I believe in learning out loud, building boldly, and showing up even when things feel messy. This is just the beginning.
